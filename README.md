# week1-refractor

I have added notes and proper indentation to major HTML sections and all CSS selectors.  The HTML tags have been labeled semantically and CSS has been arranged to read sequentially with its corresponding HTML.  I have consolidated the CSS code to be more streamlined.  The <a href> tags in the navigation were not working so I debugged them by adding proper identification using ids rather then classes.  Alt tags have been added to all images.  I made sure that the title was the name of the website and not just "website", allowing for better SEO.
